# ros-advanced-voice
First year research project for the Gates Dell Complex's Building Wide Intelligence Initiative

## Running the program:

### Updating microphone source:
The microphone source needs to be set within the launch file. To set it, run
```
$ pacmd list-sources
```
Use the output from this to find the desired microphone for the system you are running on

### Launching
A launch file has been provided to startup all the required dependencies. To start:
```
$ roslaunch ros_advanced_voice bringup.launch
```

## Program Outline:

### Speech API 
Responsible for the speech-to-text functionality of the application. Will integrate with cloud speech-to-text software to utilize existing datasets and functionality.

    ```
    Broadcast: {
        Node: "/autospeech/receive"
        Data: String
    }
    ```

### Command Processer
Primary function is to parse the commands and break them into their multi-step functions.

    ```
    Listen: { 
        Node: "/autospeech/receive"
        Function: Parse input and create logical ROS commands from the speech
        Receive: String
    }

    Broadcast: {
        Node: "/autospeech/run"
        Data: String
    }
    ```

### Scheduler
Abstraction of the command running logic to its own Node

NOTE: The scheduler will continually queue new commands that it receives from the processor

    ```
    Listen: {
        Node: "/autospeech/run"
        Function: Sequentially run the commands requested
        Receive: String
    }
    ```
