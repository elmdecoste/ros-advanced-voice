# ros-advanced-voice
First year research project for the Gates Dell Complex's Building Wide Intelligence Initiative

## Program Outline:

### Speech API 

   * Responsible for the speech-to-text functionality of the application. Will integrate with
    cloud speech-to-text software to utilize existing datasets and functionality. *

    ```
    Broadcast: {
        Node: "/autospeech/receive"
        Data: String
    }
    ```

### Command Processer

    * Primary function is to parse the commands and break them into their multi-step functions *

    ```
    Listen: { 
        Node: "/autospeech/receive"
        Function: Parse input and create logical ROS commands from the speech
        Receive: String
    }

    Listen: {
        Node: "/autospeech/status"
        Function: Check if the scheduler is currently executing
        Receive: Boolean
    }

    Broadcast: {
        Node: "/autospeech/run"
        Data: JSON
    }
    ```

### Scheduler
    
        * Abstraction of the command running logic to its own Node

        NOTE: If the scheduler recieves a new instruction set, it will stop the previous
        instructions and continue with the newly received ones. *

    ```
    Listen: {
        Node: "/autospeech/run"
        Function: Sequentially run the commands requested
        Receive: JSON
    }

    Broadcast: {
        Node: "/autospeech/status"
        Data: Boolean
    }
    ```
